## TODOs

### 1. **Enhancing UI Design**
The next phase focuses on improving the app's user interface to make it visually appealing and user-friendly:
- **Background Picture**: Add an aesthetically pleasing background image for better user engagement.
- **Symbol Pictures and Icons**: Use intuitive icons and symbols to represent features and functionalities.
- **Multi-Colored Buttons**: Introduce buttons with distinct colors for better navigation and interactivity.

### 2. **Detailed Feature Implementation**
We plan to refine three key features to enhance the user experience:
1. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Improve the prompts sent to the LLM to ensure responses are highly relevant and tailored to user input.
   - Optimize responses to make them concise, clear, and easy to understand.
2. **Concise and Step-by-Step Hints**:
   - Ensure hints are broken down into manageable steps, gradually guiding students toward solutions.
   - Avoid overwhelming students with too much information at once.
3. **Enhanced Pseudocode and Planning Support**:
   - Improve the pseudocode generation feature to help students organize their ideas more effectively before coding.
   - Make the planning phase more structured and practical for tackling complex problems.

### 3. **Adding Competitive Features**
- **Simulated Exam Ranking**:
  - Introduce a ranking system for simulated coding exams, allowing users to see how they perform compared to others.
  - Track grades over time to show progress and encourage continued improvement.
  - Provide recognition to top performers to foster motivation and engagement.
