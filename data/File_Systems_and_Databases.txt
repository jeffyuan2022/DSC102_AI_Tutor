Filesystems: virtualize disk; “file” abstraction
Networking: Communication over network
Device Drivers: Talk to other I/O devices
Process: A running program, the central abstraction in OS
Started by OS when a program is executed by user OS keeps inventory of “alive” processes (Process List) and handles apportioning of hardware among processes
A query is a program that becomes a process
A data system typically abstracts away process management because user specifies the queries/processes in system’s API High-level steps OS takes to get a process going:
1.Create a process (get Process ID; add to Process List)
2. Assign part of DRAM to process, aka its Address Space
3. Load code and static data (if applicable) to that space
4. Set up the inputs needed to run program’s main()
5. Update process’ State to Ready
6. When the process is scheduled (Running), the OS temporarily hands off control to the process to run the show!
7. Eventually, process finishes or run Destroy
