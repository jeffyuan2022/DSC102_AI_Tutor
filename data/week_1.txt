Computer - A programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process digital data
Hardware - The electronic machinery (wires, circuits, etc.) Software - Programs (instructions) and data Key Parts of Computer Hardware:
Processor - hardware that executes instructions
Main Memory (DRAM)- hardware that stores data and programs, byte-level addressing
Disk - Similar to memory, but persistent, slower, and higher capacity Network interface controller(NIC) - sends and retrieves data over the network
Key Aspects of Software:
Instruction - command understood by the hardware
Program - A collection of instructions for hardware and to execute Programming language - A human-readable formal language to write program
Application Programming Interface(API) - set of programs for use Data - Digital representation of information that is stored, processed Main Kinds of Software:
Firmware - Read-only programs that offer basic hardware control Operating System(OS) - A collection of interrelated programs that enable application/software to use hardware easily. Ex. Windows, MacOS, Linux
Application Software - A program to manipulate data (Excel, Chrome,
PostgreSQL)
Data Systems Infrastructure:
Data acquisition/preparation: Python, scikit-learn, R
Feature Engineering Training & Inference Model Selection: TensorFlow,
PyTorch
Serving/Monitoring: Dask, Spark, AWS Data Representation of Data:
Bits: All digital data are sequences of 0 & 1 (binary digits)
Amenable to high-low/off-on electromagnetism
Layers of abstraction to interpret bit sequences
Given k bits, we can represent 2 unique data items ùëò
